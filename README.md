# physiophylips_cbrain_plugins
a boutiques description of the physio (physiological noise correction for fMRI) tool for CBRAIN integration

Present description uses compiled version of the tool, that does not require fMRI. Due to limitations of MATLAB compiler, most of the parameters are moved to the config json file. The tool is compiled with Matlab R2020b and requires the relative executable R2020b.
